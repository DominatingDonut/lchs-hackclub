## The Product-ish
You will be designing a wonderfully horrid site.

Here are some more sites for your inspiration and viewing pleasure:

* [SpaceJam](https://www.spacejam.com/archive/spacejam/movie/jam.html)
* [Internet Explorer is EVIL!](http://toastytech.com/evil/)
* [CSS Zen Garden](

Be creative! (And if you want to create a more modern pretty site, you totally can!)


## Setup
If you already are familiar with web design and have a preferred setup, you can skip this stage!

We recommend using [repl.it](https://repl.it/). It's like Google Docs, but for code!

Make an account if you don't have one already, and create a new project (`+new repl`) with `HTML, CSS, JS` as the language.

If you are working with a team, you can share the repl by clicking `invite` up at top!


## Adding Stuff
### HTML

Inside your html page (`index.html`), you will see some weird looking stuffs.

A `<asdf>` is called a tag. The `</asdf>`s, with the extra `/`, are closing tags. This is the bread and butter of HTML. 

`<!DOCTYPE html>` is just announcing that this is an html file.

Try putting this inside of the `<body>` tags:

```html
<p>Hello World!</p>
```
and click `run`.

...

Here are some common tags:
* `p` is for paragraph.
* `h1`, `h2`, `h3` are headers. `h1` is biggest, and they get smaller as the number gets bigger.
* `div` is an all-purpose tag. It stands for divider or divisor. It doesn't have any special properties or use; it's just a container. It might come in handy when you start doing stuff in the next section!

## Making It Pretty(?)
### CSS

So HTML is great and all, but it lacks... style. Navigate to your css file (on the left, `style.css`).

No wonder we have no pizazz, our style is empty! Let's try changing the background color. Type the following and click run.

```css
body {
    background-color: red;
}
```
